 - Project 1 Summary; I Designed and built a financial tracker using Excel to simplify salary and budget management. Focused on accuracy, automation, and data visualization.

 - Project 1 Report; I wanted to create an organized way to track and analyze salary and budget data. The problem was the lack of an easy-to-use, visual tool for financial planning. The tools  I used were Microsoft Excel (formulas, charts, data tables). Some challenges I faced were Initially, setting up complex formulas and conditional formatting was tricky. I overcame this by researching Excel tutorials and practicing formula nesting. I used online Excel forums and video tutorials for advanced tips. I also collaborated with a classmate to double-check data accuracy.I aimed to create a detailed, automated financial tracker, and I succeeded. If I could improve it, I would add a dashboard view with dynamic charts.

 - Project 2 Summary; I Created a Python-based calculator to perform math operations from user input. Focused on user interaction, input handling, and simple computation logic.

 - Project 2 Report ; I wanted to develop a basic Python program that could handle simple math operations and data inputs, making it easier for beginners to interact with coding logic.The tools I used were Python 3 (using JDoodle online IDE). Some Challenges I faced were understanding input validation and formatting printed outputs was challenging at first. I overcame this by practicing small snippets of code separately before combining them into the final project. My goal was to build a functional calculator that accepts user input and performs calculations accurately. I achieved this, but in the future, I would like to add a graphical interface (GUI).

 - Project 3 Summary; I Developed a Python program that collects student information and performs exponent calculations, emphasizing clean structure, user input, and modular design.

 - Project 3 Report; I wanted to design a Python program that gathers student and class information, while also providing a calculator for exponent operations to practice multi-step input handling. The tools I used were Python 3 (through JDoodle online coding platform).
The biggest challenge was structuring the program in a way that was easy to follow, with clear sections for different functions. I solved this by outlining the code with comments first. I watched Python tutorial videos and checked classmates examples to learn how to organize code better. I also asked my instructor for feedback. The goal was to create a basic information and math tool, and I successfully met it.
